## Releases

Official releases of **Catastrophe Island** can be found by navigating to the [Releases](https://github.com/BC-Unity-Project-2022/Unity-Catastrophe-Island-Game-2022/releases) section from the home page of the repository.

**Catastrophe Island** uses semantic versioning to label each official release.  
This is where the version number is arranged into the following format: `AA: BB: CC - ...`  
* The number at `AA` is incremented whenever a non-backwards compatible version is released, like a major overhaul of the application.
* The number at `BB` is incremented whenever a backwards compatible, major version is released, such as a feature update.
* The number at `CC` is incremented whenever a small patch or bug fix is made, not adding any new features to the application.
* The characters at `...` indicate the type of version that has been released, giving an indication as to the current stage of development.
  
You can read more on semantic versioning [here](https://semver.org/).
